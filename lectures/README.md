# Guidelines for Serving Lectures

This directory contains lecture slides written with Reveal.js that can be served via either GitHub Pages or a local web server.

## Serving Locally (Recommended)

Serving the slides locally allows several advantages, such as the ability to see **speaker notes**.

1. Install Reveal.js. Follow the instructions here: https://revealjs.com/installation/#full-setup
2. Go to this directory in your terminal and serve it by running `npm start`.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view the slides.

## Serving via GitHub Pages

Nothing special is needed. Just push your changes to the `main` branch, and GitHub Pages will automatically serve the content.
