# Guidelines for Serving Lectures

This directory contains lecture slides written with Reveal.js that can be served via either GitHub Pages or a local web server.

## Serving Locally (Recommended for Development)

Serving the slides locally allows several advantages, such as the ability to see **speaker notes** and **automatic reloading** when you make changes to the slides.

1. Install Node.js.
1. Go to this directory in your terminal and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. Serve the presentation by running `npm start`.
1. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view the slides.

## Serving via GitHub Pages

Nothing special is needed. Just push your changes to the `main` branch, and GitHub Pages will automatically serve the content.
